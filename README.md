My First App

If you are reading this that means you decided to check out this basic app that I made.
I can say this it defintey does need some updates, but I think this is okay for my first time. 

The app is basically consists of three blog posts about video games. Yes, video games are amazing I know! 

To navigate through the app:

Well its simple really, just click the link and click any of the three tabs.
-home 
-stuff
-contact

I apologize in advance, yes I know its basic as it can ever be. Happy Gaming!
